PHI Discord Bot
===============

A robot, a friend, and a new addition to the Board of Directors.

## Setup

Not sure what it'll take to get everyone set up. I installed Node.js, npm, discord.js, and nodemon.
I'm sure some of this made it's way up into github. I'll work through setup with someone and clean it out for the next contributors

At the very least you'll need to create a file called `.env` in your project's root directory with the following contents:

	BOT_TOKEN=<secret_token_here>

I'll send you the token info upon request.

## Starting the Bot

Should be able to run the bot using only:
	
	npm run dev

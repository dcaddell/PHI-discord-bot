PHI Discord Bot
===============

A robot, a friend, and a new addition to the Board of Directors.

## Setup

Not sure what it'll take to get everyone set up. I installed Node.js, npm, discord.js, and nodemon.
I'm sure some of this made it's way up into github. I'll work through setup with someone and clean it out for the next contributors

## Starting the Bot

Should be able to run the bot using only:
	npm run dev
